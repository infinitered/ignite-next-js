# Ignite Next.js App

This is an app created with [Ignite CLI](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) from the [Ignite Next.js](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite-next-js) boilerplate.

It's built in Next.js, uses MySQL for a database, and can be deployed to Now.sh easily.

## Setup

To set up locally, follow the following steps:

1. Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and then edit it to add secret keys
2. Run `source ./.env`
3. Start the server with `yarn dev`
4. Visit http://localhost:3000
5. Anytime you change `.env`, repeat steps 2-4
